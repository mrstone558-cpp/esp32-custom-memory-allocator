# esp32-custom-memory-allocator

#About the project 
Experimental free-list based memory allocator for ESP32,
demonstrating heap reuse and manual memory management.

#Need of building it
I built it to get the deepest information about the memory and how it is managed and the threats to memory and how to make it safe and bit more information about malloc and free.

#What I learned
• How memory is managed 
• How malloc and free works
• Freelist management 
• Pointer unlinking 
• Heap reuse and Fresh allocation 
• How allocators are extremely useful and powerful 

#Conclusion
Malloc is extremely powerful as well as dangerous the easiest way to get deepest information about allocators is to create your own which I done in my project.It is a simple learning project but extremely educational.
